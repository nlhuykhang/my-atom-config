  "readme": "# ctrl-dir-scroll package\n\nThis project is an [Atom](http://atom.io/) package.\n\nIt's meant to reproduce the Line Up/Down functionality of [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and SCI_LINESCROLLUP/DOWN functionality from [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)\n\nThe desired behaviour is to have `Ctrl-Up` (`Ctrl-Alt-Up` on Mac) scroll the page a single line up, leaving the cursor in place.\nThe same should happen for `Ctrl-Down` (`Ctrl-Alt-Up` on Mac) but in the opposite direction.\n\nYou can also use `Ctrl-Shift-Up/Down` (`Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Up/Down` on Mac) to move 10 lines at a time (amount of lines configurable).\n\nWhen the cursor reaches the end of the page, it should scroll a single line as well to prevent it moving off the page (this can be disabled in settings).\n\nAlso have a look at [line-jumper](https://atom.io/packages/line-jumper) which allows you to move the cursor 10 lines at a time.\n\nAtom version 1.0 compliant thanks to [harai](https://github.com/harai)\nMultiple line jumping thanks to [kankaristo](https://github.com/kankaristo)\n",
